# TODO

Other than filling in everything mentioned in the README.

- Check on LICENSE, currently using same as tidyverse/shiny.
- Revisit slides.css, maybe it can be cleaner?
- Course website in blogdown or something else? I don't really want to put the slides etc. inside the blogdown folders.
- Add sample syllabus (with grading etc. details) to techers materials
-
