Given below are two data visualizations that violate many data visualization 
best practices. Improve these visualizations using R and the tips for effective 
visualizations that we introduced in class. You should produce one visualization 
per dataset. Your visualizaiton should be accompanies by a brief paragraph 
describing the choices you made in your improvement, specifically discussing 
what you didn't like in the original plots and why, and how you addressed them 
in the visualization you created.

On the due date you will give a brief presentation describing one of your 
improved visualizations and the reasoning for the choices you made.

### Task 1: Fisheries

Fisheries and Aquaculture Department of the Food and Agriculture Organization 
of the United Nations collects data on fisheries production of countries. 
[This Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishing_industry_by_country) 
lists fishery production of countries for 2005. For each country tonnage from 
capture and aquaculture are listed. Note that countries which harvested less 
than 100,000 tons are not included in the data.

The following plots were produced based off the data given on the Wikipedia 
page.

The source data can be found in the `fisheries` dataset in the **dsbox** package.

### Task 2: Instructional staff employee trends

The American Association of University Professors (AAUP) is a nonprofit 
membership association of faculty and other academic professionals. 
[This report](https://www.aaup.org/sites/default/files/files/AAUP_Report_InstrStaff-75-11_apr2013.pdf) 
compiled by the AAUP shows trends in instructions staff employees between 1975 
and 2011.

The following plots were produced based off the data given on the Wikipedia 
page.

The source data can be found in the `inst_staff` dataset in the **dsbox** package.
