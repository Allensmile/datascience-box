# Data Science Course in a Box <img src="dsbox/sketches/dsbox-logo.png" align="right" width="100px" />

**Note:** This repo is currently a WIP. Materials are based [this Spring 2018](http://www2.stat.duke.edu/courses/Spring18/Sta199/) course. See https://www.tidyverse.org/learn/ for other learning resources as well.

## Course description

How can we effectively and efficiently teach statistical thinking and computation to students with little to no background in either? How can we equip them with the skills and tools for reasoning with various types of data and leave them wanting to learn more? 

This introductory data science course that is our (working) answer to these questions. The courses focuses on data acquisition and wrangling, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, and effective communication and approaching statistics from a model-based, instead of an inference-based, perspective. A heavy emphasis is placed on a consitent syntax (with tools from the `tidyverse`), reproducibility (with R Markdown) and version control and collaboration (with git/GitHub). We help ease the learning curve by avoiding local installation and supplementing out-of-class learning with interactive tools (like `learnr` tutorials). By the end of the semester teams of students work on fully reproducible data analysis projects on data they acquired, answering questions they care about. 

This repository serves as a "data science course in a box" containing all materials required to teach (or learn from) the course described above.
