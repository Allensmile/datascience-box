This means getting to a meaningful, and hopefully interesting (for the students) data visualization as quickly as possible. 3.1 What is data science? Data science is an exciting discipline that allows you to turn raw data into understanding, insight, and knowledge. We’re going to learn to do this in a tidy way – more on that later! 3.2 What is this course? This is an introductory data science course designed for learners with no background in data science, programming, or statistics, but a willingness to learn in class and explore independently. Will we be doing computing? Yes. Is this an intro CS course? Not really, but many themes are shared. Is this an intro stat course? In a way, but it’s not your high school statistics course. What computing language will we learn? R. Why not language X? We can discuss that over :coffee:. 3.3 Data in the wild I like starting off by showing a few examples of easy to follow but not so simple data analyses done in R, preferably presented along with the R code. This should be the type of analysis they could do for their final project. Blog posts are often good examples for these. In Spring 2018 I used the following as examples: A year as told by fitbit by Nick Strayer R-Ladies global tour by Maelle Salmon Text analysis of Trump’s tweets confirms he writes only the (angrier) Android half by David Robinson 3.4 Your turn: UN Votes It’s now time to let the students work on their first data visualization in R. Using the unvotes package, and a pre-populated R Markdown document on RStudio Cloud, they can create and modify the two multi-variate plots, visualizing the voting history of countries in the United Nations General Assembly. library(unvotes) #&gt; If you use data from the unvotes package, please cite the following: #&gt; #&gt; Erik Voeten &quot;Data and Analyses of Voting in the UN General Assembly&quot; Routledge Handbook of International Organization, edited by Bob Reinalda (published May 27, 2013) library(tidyverse) #&gt; ── Attaching packages ─────────────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse 1.2.1 ── #&gt; ✔ ggplot2 2.2.1 ✔ purrr 0.2.4 #&gt; ✔ tibble 1.4.2 ✔ dplyr 0.7.4.9002 #&gt; ✔ tidyr 0.8.0 ✔ stringr 1.3.0 #&gt; ✔ readr 1.1.1 ✔ forcats 0.3.0 #&gt; ── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ── #&gt; ✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter() #&gt; ✖ dplyr::lag() masks stats::lag() library(lubridate) #&gt; Loading required package: methods #&gt; #&gt; Attaching package: &#39;lubridate&#39; #&gt; The following object is masked from &#39;package:base&#39;: #&gt; #&gt; date We will narrow down the analysis to four countries: United States, Russian Federation, Mexico, and Turkey. country_list &lt;- c(&quot;United States of America&quot;, &quot;Russian Federation&quot;, &quot;Mexico&quot;, &quot;Turkey&quot;) First we take a look at how often each country voted “yes” on a resolution in each year. un_votes %&gt;% filter(country %in% country_list) %&gt;% inner_join(un_roll_calls, by = &quot;rcid&quot;) %&gt;% group_by(year = year(date), country) %&gt;% summarize( votes = n(), percent_yes = mean(vote == &quot;yes&quot;) ) %&gt;% ggplot(mapping = aes(x = year, y = percent_yes, color = country)) + geom_line() + labs( title = &quot;Percentage of &#39;Yes&#39; votes in the UN General Assembly&quot;, subtitle = &quot;1946 to 2015&quot;, y = &quot;% Yes&quot;, x = &quot;Year&quot;, color = &quot;Country&quot; ) And then, we create a visualization that compares how the voting record of the United States changed over time on a variety of issues, and compare it to another country. un_votes %&gt;% filter(country %in% c(&quot;United States of America&quot;, &quot;Turkey&quot;)) %&gt;% inner_join(un_roll_calls, by = &quot;rcid&quot;) %&gt;% inner_join(un_roll_call_issues, by = &quot;rcid&quot;) %&gt;% group_by(country, year = year(date), issue) %&gt;% summarize( votes = n(), percent_yes = mean(vote == &quot;yes&quot;) ) %&gt;% filter(votes &gt; 5) %&gt;% # only use records where there are more than 5 votes ggplot(mapping = aes(x = year, y = percent_yes, color = country)) + geom_line() + facet_wrap(~ issue) + labs( title = &quot;Percentage of &#39;Yes&#39; votes in the UN General Assembly&quot;, subtitle = &quot;1946 to 2015&quot;, y = &quot;% Yes&quot;, x = &quot;Year&quot;, color = &quot;Country&quot; ) #&gt; geom_path: Each group consists of only one observation.

At this point, instead of a formal introduction on R syntax, I recommend letting students change parameters passed to these functions, such as which countries are being plotted, and reknit the document to view the changes.
