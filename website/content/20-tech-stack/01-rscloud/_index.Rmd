## Setting up your course in RStudio Cloud

First, create a new workspace on RStudio Cloud. By default, this new workspace 
will be a private workspace. All it takes to create a new workspace is a name 
and brief information for the space. You can update the information once the 
space is created, however you can't change the name of the space. For the name,  
I recommend using something along the lines of Course number - Semester.

![Creating a new workspace on RStudio Cloud](../../images/rscloud-new-workspace.png)

Next step is to invite members to the workspace. You can do this by sending 
invitations or using a sharing link. I recommend using the latter approach 
for efficiency. Once all of your students are in the course (or once drop/add 
period ends) you can change the settings so that additional members cannot join 
throughout the semester using the sharing link, and can only be added via an 
invitation from the instructor.

![Setting workspace permissions](../../images/rscloud-workspace-permissions.png)

As highlighted in the figure above, when a workspace is set to accept members 
via a shared link, the owner can also set a default permission level for those 
entering the workspace via the sharing link. Suggested permission levels and 
suggestions for mapping to course roles are as follows.

RStudio Cloud role | Permissions                               | Course role
-------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------
Admin       | Manage users, view, edit and manage all projects | Instructor
Moderator	  | View, edit and manage all projects	             | Teaching Assistant
Contributor |	Create, edit and manage their own projects	     | Student
Viewer	    | View projects shared with everyone	             | Auditor, Visitor

This set of permissions will allow instructors full access including management 
of users. Teaching assistants will be able to peek into student projects, which 
can ve very useful when helping troubleshoot. Students won't be able to see 
each others' projects. Students auditing your course or visitors, such as 
colleagues wanting to view/experience your course setup will have limited 
access.

RStudio Cloud also allows you to specify who can see the list of members. Admins 
and moderators can, by default, see all members of the workspace. I prefer to
allow contributors (students) to see the list of members and viewers (auditors 
and visitors) to not since course enrollment information should not be 
available to non-official members of the course.

## Projects

A project in RStudio Cloud is equivalent to an RStudio project. If you are an 
RStudio user, but you don't use projects, I highly recommend considering 
switching your workflow to include projects. You can learn more about them 
[here](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-projects.html#rstudio-projects).

![A new project in RStudio Cloud is a new project in the RStudio IDE](../../images/rscloud-new-project.png)

### Access

When you create a new project in your workspace, it is by default visible 
only to you plus the admins and moderators of the space. This default has two 
advantages:

1. It allows you to develop a project semi-privately and actively decide when 
the project is ready to be shared with students. This can be especially 
beneficial when developing an assessment like an exam.
2. It means when a student creates a project in the workspace it's not, by 
default, visible to other students.

When your project is ready to be shared with the students in your course, you 
can adjust the access level by clicking on the gear icon to reveal the 
settings menu.

### Copying

When a student clicks on your shared project, they are notified that this is 
a temporary copy (with red blinking text), and are given the option to make 
their own permanent copy of the project. This is the first thing a student 
should do when they start working on a project. 

When a student makes a copy of a project, a new project where they are the 
owner and that is only visible to them (and the admins and moderators of the 
space) is created. This copy contains all documents included in the 
original project and has all the packages installed (but not loaded) as well.

![Making a copy of a project](../../images/rscloud-project-copy.png)

You will see in the above screenshot that the user (on the right) is not 
the admin of the course. This screenshot was taken when logged into the demo 
workspace as a student (contributor). I strongly recommend that instructors make 
a second account for themselves on RStudio Cloud and add that user as a 
contributor to the workspace to be see what your students see when they log in. 
It's a great way to test out functionality and resolve unexpected issues 
your students might encounter, before they encounter them. I recommend using an 
incognito browser window for the student account so that you can stay logged in 
both as a student and as the instructor at the same time and test the student 
view as you develop content as an instructor.

One huge advantage of your students working in RStudio Cloud is that you as the 
instructor, and anyone with an admin and moderator role, can peek into student 
projects. While it is important for your students to learn to ask questions in 
a way that does not depend on someone else being able to see their work directly 
(and for this I strongly recommend teaching students to make 
[reprexes](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#reprex)), it is sometimes, especially 
early on, nice to be able to peek into a student's project.

## Base project template

If you consistently use a particular set of packages and/or need a particular 
set of documents to be included in each project, the base project template 
functionality will come in very handy. You can use this by defining a base 
project template for the space. Simply create a new project and add any packages 
or files you want projects created in the space to start with. After creating 
your project, select it on the Settings page as the base project template. 

![Selecting a base project template](../../images/rscloud-base-template.png)

Note that a project must be shared with everyone in the space in order to be 
used as a template; only projects which are viewable by everyone in the space 
will appear in the templates list.

## Git integration

It is possible to create (clone) a new project in RStudio Cloud from a GitHub 
repository, just like in the RStudio IDE.

![Creating a new project from GitHub repository](../../images/rscloud-git-project.png)

If you have a base project template set up for your workspace, this new project 
created from GitHub will also have the packages installed in the base project 
template.

For more on using Git and GitHub in the classroom, see [here](here).

## Limits

### Memory

Each project on RStudio Cloud is allocated 1 GB of RAM. While this is a pretty 
generous limit, actions like joining large tables or fitting complicated 
models could exceed the limit. 

I recommend testing out the any work you assign, especiallty those using large 
datasets, in order to avoid unexpected hiccups due to out of memory issues. One 
challenge is that you might have no control over what issues students might run 
into if they are working on an open ended project using a dataset of their own 
choice. In these circumstances it's helpful to keep in the back of your mind 
that one way an out of memory issue can present itself is with the RStudio Cloud 
project crashing.

### Users / projects

Another limit that you will most likely hit when setting up your course on 
RStudio Cloud is that each account is allocated one private space, with up to 
three members and five projects. Once you hit this limit RStudio Cloud will 
prompt you to submit a request to the RStudio Cloud team for more capacity. 
Rest assured that this request will be approved.

## RStudio Cloud is in alpha!

RStudio Cloud in alpha. The development team is still adding important features 
and improving performance, reliability and availability. If you have any 
questions or feedback, you can reach out on the 
[RStudio Community](https://community.rstudio.com/c/rstudio-cloud).
